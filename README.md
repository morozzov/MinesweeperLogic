# MinesweeperLogic

## Simple logic for the Monesweeper game.
- Generates a playing field of arbitrary size(50/50 default).
- It is possible to increase or decrease the number of bombs as required by changing the multiplication factor in the calculation of the number of bombs(0.15 default). 
- The field consists of bombs stored as 'X', numbers representing the number of bombs in their radius and empty cells stored as '_'.
